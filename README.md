# UtopiaSimulation
Project for the development of a Netlogo simulation to illustrate concepts from non-equilibrium systems modelling in an accessible way.

## Ideas for simulation theme

### Riots and Uprisings

- Easy to tie in to notions of Utopia (how might citizens in an ideal society interact with authority?)
- Visitor experience could be personalised by them entering details into the simulation such that they contribute an agent which persists in the simulation. Perhaps they could receive Twitter/ email updates when their Sim goes to jail?

- A version of Epstein's 2002 model is already implemented in Netlogo's model library under Social Science/Rebellion. Perhaps we could build on this as a starting point.
